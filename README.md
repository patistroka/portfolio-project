# Responsive Portfolio

This is a responsive personal portfolio project created for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It showcases key projects, highlights my skills, and includes links to my GitHub and freeCodeCamp profiles.

## Features

- **Welcome Section**: A fullscreen section (`id="welcome-section"`) with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button.
- **Projects Section**: Highlights completed projects, each displayed in `div` elements with the class `project-tile`.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes using modern CSS techniques like **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, and **media queries**.
- **Sticky Navbar**: A navigation bar (`id="navbar"`) that remains fixed at the top of the viewport for seamless navigation.
- **Custom Theme**: The use of CSS custom properties (`:root`) makes the design easily customizable.
- **Subgrid Usage**: Subgrid is utilized within project tiles to ensure consistent alignment of elements.
- **Accessible Navigation**: A responsive mobile menu with a toggle button enhances usability on smaller screens.
- **Profile Link**: A link (`id="profile-link"`) opens my GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements for better structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: 
  - **CSS Grid** for a flexible and modern layout.
  - **Flexbox** for precise alignment of items.
